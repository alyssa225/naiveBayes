                You should check for convergence after each iterations,

                If the word "jackpot" appears `k` times across all documents with
                label y=1, we will instead record `k + self.smoothing`. Then
                `p("jackpot" | y=1) = (k + self.smoothing) / Z`, where Z is a
                normalization constant that accounts for adding smoothing to

        Compute self.alpha and self.beta using the training data.
        You should store log probabilities to avoid underflow.
        This function *should* use unlabeled data within the EM algorithm.

        During the E-step, use the NaiveBayes superclass self.predict_proba to
            infer a distribution over the labels for the unlabeled examples.
            Note: you should *NOT* replace the true labels with your predicted
            labels. You can use a `np.where` statement to only update the
            labels where `np.isnan(y)` is True.

        During the M-step, update self.alpha and self.beta, similar to the
            `fit()` call from the NaiveBayes superclass. However, when counting
            words in an unlabeled example to compute p(x | y), instead of the
            binary label y you should use p(y | x).

        For help understanding the EM algorithm, refer to the lectures and
            the handout. In particular, Figure 2 shows the algorithm for
            semi-supervised Naive Bayes.

        self.alpha should contain the marginal probability of each class label.

        self.beta should contain the conditional probability of each word
            given the class label: p(x | y). This should be an array of shape
            [n_vocab, n_labels].  Remember to use `self.smoothing` to smooth word counts!
            See __init__ for details. If we see M total
            words across all documents with label y=1, have a vocabulary size
            of V words, and see the word "jackpot" `k` times, then:
            `p("jackpot" | y=1) = (k + self.smoothing) / (M + self.smoothing * V)`
            Note that `p("jackpot" | y=1) + p("jackpot" | y=0)` will not sum to 1;
            instead, `sum_j p(word_j | y=1)` will sum to 1.

        Note: if self.max_iter is 0, your function should call
            `self.initialize_params` and then break. In each
            iteration, you should complete both an E-step and
            an M-step.

        r"""
        Using fit self.alpha and self.beta, compute the likelihood of the data.
            This function *should* use unlabeled data.
            This likelihood is defined in equation (14) of `naive_bayes.pdf`.

        For unlabeled data, we predict `p(y_i = y' | X_i)` using the
            previously-learned p(x|y, beta) and p(y | alpha).
            For labeled data, we define `p(y_i = y' | X_i)` as
            1 if `y_i = y'` and 0 otherwise; this is because for labeled data,
            the probability that the ith example has label y_i is 1.

        Following equation (14) in the `naive_bayes.pdf` writeup, the log
            likelihood of the data after t iterations can be written as:

            \sum_{i=1}^N \log \sum_{y'=1}^2 \exp(
                \log p(y_i = y' | X_i, \alpha, \beta) + \alpha_{y'}
                + \sum_{j=1}^V X_{i, j} \beta_{j, y'})

            You can visualize this formula in http://latex2png.com

            The tricky aspect of this likelihood is that we are simultaneously
            computing $p(y_i = y' | X_i, \alpha^t, \beta^t)$ to predict a
            distribution over our latent variables (the unobserved $y_i$) while
            at the same time computing the probability of seeing such $y_i$
            using $p(y_i =y' | \alpha^t)$.

            Note: In implementing this equation, it will help to use your
                implementation of `stable_log_sum` to avoid underflow. See the
                documentation of that function for more details.
